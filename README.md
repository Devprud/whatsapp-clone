⭐ Hello, i made this repository in github to put my trial in making the clone of WhatsApp Web.
⭐ Currently this is only made of HTML & CSS as i didn't learn JS yet but i am going to make changes to this as i go through JavaScript.
⭐ Anyone who is interested in making this even better is welcome to do it, and by your changes i would also be able to learn new stuff,

THANK YOU IF YOU MADE ANY CHANGES TO THIS REPOSITORY.
